TO-DO
=====

BUG
- fix the issue with deleted cvs files becoming zombies after cvs update (if they were not deleted)
- fix the bug with the cvs commit listener, when a file is moved to attic:
  - cvs revision comparator doesn't know what is "NONE"
  - there seems to be an attempt of updating a file that was deleted...look into that
- fix the issue with jnotify not watching freshly created directories (ParadeJNotifyListener)


ENHANCEMENT (EASY)
- tell which makumba jars were found if more than 1 was found (MakumbaManager)
- display errors / incorrect behaviour of MakumbaManager in red in view (RowStoreViewManager, MakumbaManager)

ENHANCEMENT (MEDIUM)
- actionLog JSP (hibernate-mak driven) that displays the 10-20 last things that happened to give a feeling of what's going on
- improve log view:
  - automatically select view that is more relevant depending on last activity (last hour, day, week...)
    (LogViewManager)
- also paint a row browser of a non-watched row in pink (FileViewManager)
- administration: enable easy removal of rows via the admin interface (admin/index.jsp, AdminAction, Parade)

ENHANCEMENT (HARD)
- optimise operations for deletion of a directory: delete cache of all subfiles at once...if possible!
  (we get a delete notification for each single file, and execute one query for each cache update...)
  (ParadeJNotifyListener)
- cache active sessions in the listener so that parade still knows about them on restart (and display people who
  were there before restart) (ParadeSessionListener, probably also Parade and Parade.hbm.xml)
- implement tabbed browsing: common header foll all pages, with quick link to row store view, "my row" view, dashboard) (XUL?)
- implement dashobard view: recent commits, my last modified files, ...
- deploy parade and the webapps in two separate tomcats
