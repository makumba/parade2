BUG (HIGH PRIO)

BUG (LOW PRIO)
- when a LOCALLY_MODIFIED file was moved to Attic, a CVS update won't update the Entries file. so it is necessary to parse
  the output of the CVS command and reset the CVS cache of the file accordingly. this can be done by writing a regexp that looks for
  "cvs update: conflict: `<STUFF>' is modified but no longer in the repository". (CvsController: pass the log to the CVSManager,
  CVSManager: after Entries parsing check also the log)

ENHANCEMENT (EASY)
- paint a row browser of a non-watched row in pink (FileViewManager)

ENHANCEMENT (MEDIUM)
- display rows that a user uses next to the nick in the parade welcome page (IndexServlet, index.ftl)
- improve log view:
  - automatically select view that is more relevant depending on last activity (last hour, day, week...)
    (LogViewManager)
- administration: enable easy removal of rows via the admin interface (admin/index.jsp, AdminAction, Parade)

ENHANCEMENT (HARD)
- optimise operations for deletion of a directory: delete cache of all subfiles at once...if possible!
  (we get a delete notification for each single file, and execute one query for each cache update...)
  (ParadeJNotifyListener)
- implement tabbed browsing: common header for all pages, with quick link to row store view, "my row" view, dashboard) (XUL?)
- implement dashboard view: recent commits, my last modified files, ...
- deploy parade and the webapps in two separate tomcats
