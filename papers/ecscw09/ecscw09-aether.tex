\begin{abstract}
  This document is formatted in accordance with the ECSCW formatting
  guidelines by means of the ecscw2007.cls \LaTeX\ class.
  Use this document as a template.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Document layout} 

The manuscript must not have page number or running headers and footers. 

The text bloc (the printed area) should measure and must not exceed
140 x 227 mm; it must have a one-column format and be positioned at
the center of the page.  In A4 format, this corresponds to 35 mm
margins on all sides. If you use other formats, e.g., US Letter,
please make sure the text bloc measures 140 x 227 mm (i.e., make sure
line lengths do not exceed 140 mm).

\section*{Title, author, abstract} 

The title of the article must be preceded by 50 mm blank space (the blank space on 
top of the first page will be used for editorial purposes). The title should be set in 24 
point Times, flushed left. 

The title should be followed by the name of the author(s) in 14 point Times, 
flushed left. Immediately after the name of the author, the name and country of the 
affiliation of the author should be given in a separate line (12 point Times, flushed 
left). 

The title, author's name, and author's affiliation should be followed by a short 
{\bf abstract} of not more than 200 words, which clearly summarizes the paper. The
abstract should be set in 10 point Helvetica (or an equivalent sans serif font) with 13 
point line leading (line space). The abstract should have 24 point space before and 
after. 

\section*{Body text}
 
Body text should be set in 12 point Times (the font used here) or an
equivalent serif font. Line spacing (leading) should be 15 point. The
first paragraph after a headline should not be indented; otherwise the
first line of a body text paragraph should be indented by 5 mm. Body
text should be justified (i.e., do not use a ragged-right style).

Headings should be set in Times and flush left:

\begin{itemize}
\item Level 1: 18 point, 24 point space before, 12 point after. 
\item Level 2: 14 point, 18 point space before, 9 point after. 
\item Level 3: 12 point, 12 point space before, 6 point after. 
\end{itemize}

Quoted passages of more than 40 words should be set off from the text by 
indenting the left-hand margin 5 mm. Such quotations should be set in 10 point 

Times with 13 point line spacing, with 2 mm additional spacing before and after the 
quotation. 

Trademarks and system names should be set in small caps, for example,
{\sc The Coordinator}. 

\section*{References}

Citations should be incorporated into the text, either directly in the
sentence (``As claimed by \cite{bib:Bowers91}...'') or at the end,
with author's name and date of publication in parenthesis:
\citep{bib:Bowers91}.


References should be listed at the end of the article, after the Notes, in 
alphabetical and chronological order. References should be set in 10 point Times, 
with 5 mm hanging indents.

the page.\footnote{This is a footnote.} Notes should be numbered
consecutively with Arabic numbers, and indicated in the text by
superscript numbers.

printing without further processing.
