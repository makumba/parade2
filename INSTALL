Installation instructions for ParaDe 2
======================================

By following these instructions, you'll obtain a directory called "tomcat-parade" containing everything you need
to run a production version of ParaDe.

1) Get a Tomcat version and extract it into the folder tomcat-fresh, e.g. by typing
   cp -r ../apache-tomcat-5.5.28 tomcat-fresh
   
2) Make sure you have a MySQL server running on port 3306 with an empty database called "parade".
   The settings can be changed in webapp/WEB-INF/classes/hibernate.cfg.xml if needed

3) Check if the server.xml in tomcat/conf corresponds to the tomcat you'll use. In order to do so,
   go to tomcat/conf and if necessary copy the appropriate server-tomcatXX.xml file to server.xml
   By default server.xml is working for a tomcat 5.5

4) Run the install script: sh install.sh

5) Go to tomcat-parade/webapps/parade/WEB-INF/classes and copy parade.properties.example to parade.properties
   The example file is configured to work with this installation, but you can adjust it if necessary

6) That's it! You should be able to run ParaDe by launching the tomcat.sh script in the directory tomcat-parade

7) In order to register new rows into parade, you need to edit the rows.properties file which is located in the
   webapps/parade/WEB-INF/classes directory. By default this configuration file only contains a reference to the
   root ParaDe row
