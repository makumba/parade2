If you intend to develop ParaDe, you probably should know how to configure it.
This checkout provides you with two things:
- One way to run ParaDe from Eclipse
- One way to run ParaDe on a server


== Software that should be installed ==
- Java 5
- Tomcat 5.5
- MySQL Server
- Apache Ant tools
- JNotify should be installed (most of the time this is compiled into the Linux kernel)


== Setting up ParaDe for Eclipse, with Aether ==
01. Checkout parade2 from CVS (for details look on: http://parade.sourceforge.net)

02. Copy "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/parade.properties.example" to "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/parade.properties" and make sure you have the dummyAuthorizer enabled (so u can login as anyone)

03. Configure the file "/tomcat.properties" (port, manager password, ...)

04. Create database with the name "parade"

05. In "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/Makumba.conf" make sure that "hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto" is set to create and not update during the first launch and if necessary configure password in "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/Makumba.conf". Also verify that in this file the MySQL dialect is set to INNODB and not to default.

06. Import the "/backup_rules.sql" file into your database for inserting the percolation rules

07. Configure the parade2-tomcat runner (i.e. set the catalina_home var to your tomcat directory, if it's not already set)

08. Do a project clean first and then run parade2-tomcat

09. When you see "INIT: Initialisation took ... " stop it again. Now you have a "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/rows.properties" file

10. Configure your rows in "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/rows.properties" like it is done in the example at the top of the file

11. In "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/Makumba.conf" make sure that "hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto" is set to update and not create. Otherwise your database content will be deleted every time.

12. To enable aether: in "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/parade.properties", uncomment the aether properties and set aether.enabled to true

13. Run parade again, You can activate the crawling to compute all the relationships trough the admin page (see below). This can take a little time

14. That's it!


== Useful things to know ==
Default url:
http://localhost:5050/

Admin page:
http://localhost:5050/admin

Aether page:
http://localhost:5050/aether

== Common problems ==
- How do I create a new user?
If you login with a non existing username you'll get a create new user page where you can create a new user.

- There are no rows (except root) on the ParaDe mainpage
If you changed your rows.properties file you need to register the new rows. On the admin page press the "register new rows" button.

- My database is emptied every time I launch ParaDe.
Make sure that in "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/Makumba.conf" the property "hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto" is set to update and not create. Otherwise your database content will be deleted every time.

- When I save a file no percolation happens
Make sure that you've imported the "backup_rules.sql" in the database.

- The crawling does not start from the admin page
Stop and restart ParaDe and try it again. It is a little bug and happens sometimes.

- I have errors during startup of ParaDe
Make sure your database is named ParaDe and your username/password are correctly set. Make sure the database is set to INNODB.
