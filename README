If you intend to develop ParaDe, you probably should know how to configure it.
This checkout provides you with two things:
- one way to run ParaDe from Eclipse
- one way to run ParaDe on a server


== Software that should be installed ==
- Java 5
- Tomcat 5.5
- MySQL Server
- Apache Ant tools
- JNotify should be installed (most of the time this is compiled into the Linux kernel)


== Setting up ParaDe for Eclipse, with Aether ==
01. Checkout parade2 from CVS (for details look on: http://parade.sourceforge.net)

02. Copy "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/parade.properties.example" to "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/parade.properties" and make sure you have the dummyAuthorizer enabled (so u can login as anyone)

03. Configure the file "/tomcat.properties" (port, manager password, ...)

04. Create database with the name "parade", and if necessary configure password in "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/Makumba.conf". Verify that in this file the MySQL dialect is set to INNODB and not MyISAM

05. Import the "/backup_rules.sql" file into your database for inserting the percolation rules

06. Configure the parade2-tomcat runner (i.e. set the catalina_home var to your tomcat directory, if it's not already set)

07. Run parade2-tomcat

08. Stop it again :) now you have a "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/rows.properties" file

09. Configure your rows in "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/rows.properties" like it is done in the example at the top of the file

10. To enable aether: in "/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/parade.properties", uncomment the aether.enabled line and the aether.databaseName

11. Run parade again, this time it will compute all the relationships (this can take a little time). You can activate this also trough the admin page (see below).

12. That's it!
