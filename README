If you intend to develop ParaDe, you probably should know how to configure it.

This checkout provides you with two things:
- one way to run ParaDe from Eclipse
- one way to run ParaDe on a server

== Software that should be installed ==
- Java 5
- Tomcat 5.5
- MySQL Server
- Apache Ant tools

== Setting up ParaDe for Eclipse, with Aether ==

01. Checkout parade2 from CVS (for details look on: http://parade.sourceforge.net)

02. Copy /webapp/WEB-INF/classes/parade.properties.example to /webapp/WEB-INF/classes/parade.properties and make sure you have the dummyAuthorizer enabled (so u can login as anyone)

03. Configure the file /tomcat.properties (port, manager password, ...)

04. Create database with the name "parade", and if necessary configure password in /webapp/WEB-INF/classes/Makumba.conf. Verify that in this file the MySQL dialect is set to INNODB and not MyISAM

05. Configure the parade2-tomcat runner (i.e. set the catalina_home var to your tomcat directory, if it's not already set)

06. Run parade2-tomcat

07. Stop it again :) now you have a /webapp/WEB-INF/classes/rows.properties file

08. Configure your rows in /webapp/WEB-INF/classes/rows.properties like it is done in the example at the top of the file

09. In /webapp/WEB-INF/classes/parade.properties, uncomment the aether.enabled line and the aether.databaseName

10. Import the /backup_rules.sql file into your database for inserting the percolation rules

11. Run parade again. this time it will compute all the relationships (this can take a little time)

12. That's it!
