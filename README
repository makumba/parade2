If you intend to develop ParaDe, you probably should know how to configure it.

This checkout provides you with two things:
- one way to run ParaDe from Eclipse
- one way to run ParaDe on a server

== Setting up ParaDe for Eclipse
In the first case, you need to specify your 'catalina.home' variable so that Eclipse knows where is a tomcat
it can use to run ParaDe. Go to "Run->Run->Arguments", then click on "variables" in the lower box, and create a new
"catalina.home" var that points to a fresh tomcat checkout. Make sure that after creating the variable, you
did not alter the launch parameters (by default Eclipse inserts selected vars in the parameters).

Now need to go to webapp/WEB-INF/classes and rename parade-eclipse.properties to parade.properties.
This property file contains the properties corresponding to the folder structure used in Eclipse

== Setting up ParaDe on a server
Please refer to the INSTALL file and follow the instructions


Basically, the difference between the two configurations is that in the case of Eclipse, the contents of "tomcat-eclipse"
are used with the binaries of the tomcat you indicate, while in the case of an installation on a server, the script
alters a fresh tomcat installation. On a long run the idea would be to deploy ParaDe as a WAR, but this is not so easy to
achieve.
