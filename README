If you intend to develop ParaDe, you probably should know how to configure it.

This checkout provides you with two things:
- one way to run ParaDe from Eclipse
- one way to run ParaDe on a server

== Setting up ParaDe for Eclipse, with Aether

1/ checkout parade2

2/ copy webapp/WEB-INF/classes/parade.properties.example to webapp/WEB-INF/classes/parade.properties and make sure you have the dummyAuthorizer enabled (so u can login as anyone)

3/ configure /tomcat.properties (port, manager password, ...)

4/ create a "parade" database, and if necessary configure password in webapp/WEB-INF/classes/localhost_mysql_parade.properties AND webapp/WEB-INF/classes/localhost_mysql_parade.cfg.xml

5/ configure the parade2-tomcat runner (i.e. set the catalina_home var, if it's not already set)

6/ run parade2-tomcat

7/ stop it again :) now you have a webapp/WEB-INF/classes/rows.properties

8/ configure your rows in rows.properties

9/ in parade.properties, uncomment the aether.enabled line and the aether.databaseName

10/ run parade again. this time it will compute all the relationships

11/ that's it!
