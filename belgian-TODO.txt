m Excel
m dissapearance of high-nimbus events
m if something in work of others is in my focus, then i should see it differently there

indexes; look at queries and make indexes for all fields used in WHERE
move myWork and workOfOthers low
Rethink howto work with the checkboxes in mywork.
Make my work update when a file is saved

enable/disable percolation during crawling? Make methods like enable/disable in aether.java


row-same= same file
CVS-same= file checked out from the same CVS file in different rows

++ Test Aether:
---------------
- work on CVS-folder-neighbour files, row-folder-neighbour 
- same folder
- same parent of folders
- work on CVS-related files
- work on my row
- different time work
- work on my trainee's row
- work: write, read, execute, commit	

Focus widget, nimbus widget
Percolation rules per user
if something in work of others is in my focus, then i should see it differently there
I should see how my work shows in work of others
Things in mywork shouldn't disappear after 15-20min... Or until commit, or manual remove...
Show my work/work of others on first page

Whenever you "fix" something
- if it doesn't work, put it in this file
- if you can, commit it in code
- if it's a howto, update some document (README == parade.sourceforge, code guide)
- if it's something you wonder, send an email to parade-developers@lists.sourceforge.net
