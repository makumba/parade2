This package holds servlets which are involved in the access mechanism.
<br>
Before each access, the {@link org.makumba.parade.tools.TriggerFilter}
invokes the {@link AccessServlet}.
<br>
After each access, it invokes the {@link EndAccessServlet}.
<br>
<br>
The {@link DatabaseLogServlet} is writing one {@link
org.makumba.parade.model.ActionLog} per relevant access. It also can be
invoked through the TriggerFilter's redirectToServlet method, which
redirects a request to a servlet and sets an attribute.
<br>
In addition to the ActionLogs, the DatabaseLogServlet also logs regular
log events provided by java.util.Logging, log4j and the
PerThreadPrintStream class.<br>
