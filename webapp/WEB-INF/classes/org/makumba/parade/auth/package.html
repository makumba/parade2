This package holds a number of implementations of the {@link Authorizer} which make it possible for ParaDe to authenticate users.

The configuration of authorizers is done in parade.properties:<br>
<pre>
parade.authorizerClass=org.makumba.parade.auth.DummyAuthorizer
parade.authorizationMessage=ParaDe, please provide login and password
</pre>

Other authorizers may require more configuration, as for instance the {@link LDAPAuthorizer}
